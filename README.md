#MAVSDK-Swift-Starter-App

This is just a start framework for anyone that wants to start building an iOS app using the MAVSDK-Swift framework. You can download this then change everything for your project. It's just a starter single page app with MAVSDK-Swift imported. Best of luck!

Clone the project then go into terminal and run `carthage bootstrap --platform ios` to download all dependencies. Once that's done build to make sure everything compiled correctly.
